//  ESPD35_MeteoPlaneRadar
//  Prevzato z petus/MeteoPlaneRadar 0.7.0 (autor Petr / chiptron.cz) beze zmen
//  v logice; obrazovky nad timto modulem jsou pro ESPD-3.5 nakreslene znovu.
//
//  Spot electricity price (OTE via spotovaelektrina.cz) and the Czech
//  generation mix (ENTSO-E via the Fraunhofer ISE energy-charts API).
//
//  Free, no key, no registration - see the long note in Config.h for what each
//  endpoint answers and why the mix is asked for a few hours at a time rather
//  than a whole day.
//
//  TWO sources in one module because they are one subject: the price screen
//  says what electricity costs right now and the mix screen says why. They are
//  fetched independently though - one being down never blanks the other.
//
//  WHAT THIS MODULE DOES NOT DO: it never decides what the user actually pays.
//  The spot price is the exchange price for the energy alone; distribution,
//  the regulated components and VAT are all on top of it and differ by supplier
//  and region. Settings_PriceFee() and Settings_PriceVat() hold what the user
//  told us about their own tariff, and Energy_FinalCzkKwh() applies exactly
//  that and nothing else. With both at zero the screens show the bare exchange
//  price, which is the honest default: a made-up surcharge would be worse than
//  none, because it would look like the real bill.
